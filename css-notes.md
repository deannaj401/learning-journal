### 3 color properties:
1. RGB: red green and blue are used
1. Hex Codes: 6 digit codes that represent red green and ble preceded by #
1. Color names: 147 predefined color names 
* ```/* */ ``` for css comments

## back ground color
* specify the same 3 ways as foreground color
* if no bg color is specified then it is transparent
* default bg is white

### opacity
* opacity value is between 0.0 and 1.0

not child elements
