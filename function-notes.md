## How Javascript makes pages dynamic

* Javascript allows you to make web pages
more interactive by accessing and modifying the 
content and markup used in a web page while its
being viewed in the browser

Javascript lets users:

1. Access the content of the page

1. Modify the content of the page

1. Program rules or instructions the browser     can follow
1. React to events triggered by the user or browser

## Scripts

* A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* a browser may use different parts of the script
depending on how the user interacts with
the web page

* Scripts can run different sections
of the code in response to the situation
around them

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

1. Define the goal
2. design the script by splitting
the goal into a series of tasks
3. code each step


## Rules for naming variables

6 rules for naming variables

1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords are 
special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
firstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
lastNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).

 ## Expressions

Two types of expressions

1. expressions that just assign
a value to a variable

var color = 'beige';

2. Expressions that use 2 or mor
vaues to return a single value

    var area = 3 * 2;

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

## Operators

Assignment operators 
 - assign a value to a variable

Comparison operators
- compare 2 values and return true or false

Artithmetic operators

+ - / * ( basic math operators)

++ increment - adds 1 to the current number

-- decrement - subtracts 1 from the current number

% modulus - divides 2 values and returns the remainder


There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

When you place quotes around
a number, it is a string (not
a numeric data type), and
you cannot perform addition
operations on strings.

If you try to add a numeric data
type to a string, then the number
becomes part of the string,

If you try to use any of the other
arithmetic operators on a string,
then the value that results is
usually a value called NaN. This
means "not a number."

## Function


Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task.

To create a function you give it a name and 
then write the statements needed to achieve 
its task inside the curly braces
This is known as a function declaration

to declare a function use the function keyword

give the function a name (identifier) followed by paretheses

the statements that perform the task sit in a code block

functions store the code required to perform a specific task
and that the script can ask the function to perform that task
whenever needed

to run the code in the function you use the function name
followed by paretheses

The items that appear inside these paretheses are known 
as the parameters of the function which act like variable names.

When you call a function that has parameters you specify the 
values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name.
The values are called arguments and they can be provided as values or variables
