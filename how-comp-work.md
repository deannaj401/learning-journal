# How Computers Work

## There are actually 4 things a Computer does

* Input
* Storage
* Processing
* Output

Input is pretty self explanatory. It can come from a keyboard, a phone, a car or really anything at all depending on the type of computer

Storage is memory

Processing is a series of commands that tell the computer what to do with the information that has been input

Output is the result.

## Computers use Binary Code

Binary code is 1 and 0

The computer uses the Binary code to calculate numbers letters and pictures. 

Its done at lightning speed so it seems instantaneous

Circuits are used to process the binary code and the more circuts or bits you have the faster the computer

Software gives commands to the circuits for processing. 
Coding is using binary but converted to english.
