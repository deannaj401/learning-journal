# Setting up Javascript in an HTML file

## There are 3 layers
* Content Layer 
    - Html layer
* Presentation Layer
    - Css layer
* Behaviour Layer
    - javascript layer


This is called seperation of concerns

Web designers use Progressive Enhancement for easier accessability
- firt the html layer for structure
- then add the css layer for presentation
- then the javascript for behaviour

by keeping the scripts on seperate pages the website will still work even if the user can't view javascript or some of the css elements

HTML uses ``` <script>``` to tell the browser to use Javascript

JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE
JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means
something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

To write a comment that stretches over more than
one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
the /* characters and ending with the * / characters.
Anything between these characters is not processedÂ·
by the JavaScript interpreter.
